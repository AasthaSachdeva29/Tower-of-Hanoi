Tower of Hanoi Problem
Overview
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem involving the movement of a stack of different-sized disks between three pegs, subject to specific rules. It's a fundamental example of recursion and algorithm design.

Problem Statement
Three pegs: A, B, C.
A stack of disks on peg A.
Move all disks to peg C while following these rules:
One disk at a time.
Larger disks can't be placed on smaller ones.
Use peg B for temporary storage.
Algorithm
If one disk, move it to peg C.
For n > 1:
Move n-1 disks to peg B.
Move the largest disk to peg C.
Move n-1 disks to peg C.
Complexity
Time complexity: O(2^n), where n is the number of disks. Exponential due to recursion.

Applications
Teaches recursion and algorithmic thinking in computer science and mathematics.

Conclusion
The Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic illustration of recursion and problem-solving, with applications in algorithm analysis and education.
